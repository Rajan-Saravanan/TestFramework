## Providing Test Data to Test
Insider resources/testdata folder JSON test data files are organized.

In this framework Test Data can be given through Json file. To overcome the disadvantages of Excel file for storing test data Json file is used.

Create a json file and place a array object inside the json to provide test data to Test Class. Don't forget to implement Dataprovider method inside test class.
